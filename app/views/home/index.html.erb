<p>Primary is a multiple choice quiz app that uses a <em>traditional ELO system</em> to rank users and deliver knowledge-level appropriate questions. Primary provides a simple way to keep your web dev skills sharp, and keep your competition sharper.</p>
<p>The multiple choice format makes the testing process quick> &mdash; perfect for those times when you're away from your projects.</p>
<p>As an anonymous user, you can test yourself on questions from many categories. For the Rails Rumble, the categories are limited to: <em>HTML, CSS, and Ruby</em> (cause hey, we're all in that kind of mindframe). They range in difficulty based on past user success rate.</p>
</p>At any time, <em>register to save your progress</em> (including your ELO). Registered users are able to create questions, which affects their ELO even more.</p>
