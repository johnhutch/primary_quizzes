<p>Primary is a multiple choice quiz app that uses a <em>traditional ELO system</em> to rank users and deliver knowledge-level appropriate questions. Primary offers an effective way to challenge yourself, and challenge your competition.</p>
<p>The multiple choice format makes the testing process quick &mdash; perfect for those times when you're away from your projects, but have coding on your mind.</p>
<p>As an anonymous user, you can test yourself on questions from many categories. For the Rails Rumble, the categories are limited to: <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, and <em>Ruby on Rails</em> (cause hey, it's kind of all we're thinking about right now). All questions have a dynamic difficulty that is based on user success rate.</p>
</p>At any time, <em>register to actually start saving your progress</em>. Registered users are able to create questions, which can affect their ELO even more.</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately</em>, we didn't get around to flagging bad/wrong questions; we're all working on the honor system here! If you don't like a question, just click "Test yourself" again. The questions are pulled randomly from a range based on your ELO.</p>
